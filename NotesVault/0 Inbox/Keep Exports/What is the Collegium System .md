What is Collegium?
	-	Collegium system of the Supreme Court (SC) and the High Courts (HCs) of India is based on the precedence established by the "Three Judges Cases (1982, 1993, 1998) ".
	-	It is a legally valid system of appointment and transfer of judges in the SC and all HCs.
	-	It is a system of checks and balance, which ensures the independence of the senior judiciary in India.
The Collegium System: A detailed backgrounder
	-	The Collegium of judges is the Indian SC's invention.
	-	It does not figure in the Constitution, which says judges of the SC and HC are appointed by the President and speaks of a process of consultation.
	-	In effect, it is a system under which judges are appointed by an institution comprising judges.
	-	After some judges were superseded in the appointment of the CJI in the 1970s and attempts made subsequently to effect a mass transfer of High Court judges across the country.
	-	Hence there was a perception that the independence of the judiciary was under threat. This resulted in a series of cases over the years.
The Judges Cases
	-	The First Judges Case (1981) ruled that the "consultation" with the CJI in the matter of appointments must be full and effective.
	-	However, it rejected the idea that the CJI's opinion, albeit carrying great weight, should have primacy.
	-	The Second Judges Case (1993) introduced the Collegium system, holding that "consultation" really meant "concurrence".
	-	It added that it was not the CJI's individual opinion, but an institutional opinion formed in consultation with the two senior-most judges in the SC.
	-	On a Presidential Reference in its opinion, the SC, in the Third Judges Case (1998) expanded the Collegium to a five-member body, comprising the CJI and four of his senior-most colleagues.
The procedure followed by the Collegium:
Appointment of CJI
	-	The President of India appoints the CJI and the other SC judges.
	-	As far as the CJI is concerned, the outgoing CJI recommends his successor.
	-	In practice, it has been strictly by seniority ever since the supersession controversy of the 1970s.
	-	The Union Law Minister forwards the recommendation to the PM who, in turn, advises the President.
Other SC Judges
	-	For other judges of the top court, the proposal is initiated by the CJI.
	-	The CJI consults the rest of the Collegium members, as well as the senior-most judge of the court hailing from the High Court to which the recommended person belongs.
	-	The consultees must record their opinions in writing and it should form part of the file.
	-	The Collegium sends the recommendation to the Law Minister, who forwards it to the Prime Minister to advise the President.
For HC
	-	The CJs of HC is appointed as per the policy of having Chief Justices from outside the respective States. The Collegium takes the call on the elevation.
	-	High Court judges are recommended by a Collegium comprising the CJI and two senior-most judges.
	-	The proposal, however, is initiated by the Chief Justice of the High Court concerned in consultation with two senior-most colleagues.
	-	The recommendation is sent to the Chief Minister, who advises the Governor to send the proposal to the Union Law Minister.
Does the Collegium recommend transfers too?
	-	Yes, the Collegium also recommends the transfer of Chief Justices and other judges.
	-	Article 222 of the Constitution provides for the transfer of a judge from one High Court to another.
	-	When a CJ is transferred, a replacement must also be simultaneously found for the High Court concerned. There can be an acting CJ in a High Court for not more than a month.
	-	In matters of transfers, the opinion of the CJI "is determinative", and the consent of the judge concerned is not required.
	-	However, the CJI should take into account the views of the CJ of the High Court concerned and the views of one or more SC judges who are in a position to do so.
	-	All transfers must be made in the public interest, that is, "for the betterment of the administration of justice".
Loopholes in the Collegium system
	-	Many have faulted the system, not only for its being seen as something unforeseen by the Constitution makers but also for the way it functions.
	-	Opaqueness and a lack of transparency, and the scope for nepotism are cited often.
	-	The attempt made to replace it by a 'National Judicial Appointments Commission' was struck down by the court in 2015 on the ground that it posed a threat to the independence of the judiciary.
	-	Some do not believe in full disclosure of reasons for transfers, as it may make lawyers in the destination court chary of the transferred judge.
	-	Embroilment in public controversies and having relatives practising in the same High Court could be common reasons for transfers.
Scope for transparency
	-	In respect of appointments, there has been an acknowledgement that the "zone of consideration" must be expanded to avoid criticism that many appointees hail from families of retired judges.
	-	The status of a proposed new memorandum of procedure, to infuse greater accountability, is also unclear.
	-	Even the majority opinions admitted the need for transparency, now the Collegium's resolutions are now posted online, but reasons are not given.
