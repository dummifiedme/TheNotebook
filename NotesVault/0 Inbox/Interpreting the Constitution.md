1. [[../1 Projects/UPSC/GS2/Article 366]]  - Contains definitions of commonly used terms throughout the constitution or laws.
2. The tools evolved by the apex court
	- Unless the context requires otherwise, commonly held meaning of English term shall be used to interpret the constitution
3. The Doctrine of liberal interpretation
	-  The constitution should be so interpreted as to give relevance and meaning to every word, phrase, every sentence.
4. The doctrine of progressive interpretation
	-  The provisions must be so interpreted as to adapt them to contemporary realities.
	-  All parts of the constitution must be read together.
5. Doctrine of prospective over interpretation
	- A fresh interpretation of constitution shall become operational from that moment prospective and will not have retrospective review. #But❗
