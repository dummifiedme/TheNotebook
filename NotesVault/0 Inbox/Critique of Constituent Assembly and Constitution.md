### 1. Constitution was unrepresentative
**Debunking the Criticism:**
- Why not a freshly elected representatives?
	- Congress originally demanded a directly elected constitutional assemble but dropped this demand as this would delay the creating of the assembly.
- The difference between voice and opinion representation:
	- Physical representation for all the sections was not feasible yet ==every shade of public opinion was represented==.
- The draft constitution was placed in public domain. Submissions were invited and several were considered and some also incorporated.
- The members also adopted the tool of public reason and emphasized larger public interest over sectional interest.
- The constitution ==reflects will of many== rather than the needs of the few.
