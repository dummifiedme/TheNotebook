## Idea of Sub-Category in OBC
A:
| Year | Name of Committee                                  | Sub-Category                    |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| {1955} | {First Backward Class Committee}                     | {Backward and Extremely Backward} |
| {1979} | {Mandal Commission + dissent note by member LK Naik} | {Intermediate and Depressed}      |
| {2015} | {NCBC}                                               | {Extremely BC, More BC, BC}       |


NCBC in 2015 proposed sub-categorizations in OBC 
1. Extremely BC 
	- {-> Nomadic, aboriginal tribes, semi-nomadic tribes 
	- -> Carrying out their traditional occupations}
2. More Backward Classes 
	- -> {vocational groups carrying on with their traditional occupations}
3. Backward Classes
	- -> {comparatively more forward}
