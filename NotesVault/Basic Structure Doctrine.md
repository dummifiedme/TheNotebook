## Basics of the Basic Structure Doctrine

*   Power of parliament to make laws is not absolute in nature.
    *   Judiciary to adjudicate the validity.
    *   Violation by parliament/SL: SC can declare laws invalid or *ultra vires*.
*   Power to amend the constitution to parliament for making constitution an adaptable document.
*   Article 368 gives an impression that the parliament's amending powers are absolute and encompass all the parts of the document.
    *   But the Supreme Court has acted as a brake to the legislative enthusiasm of the parliament ever since the independence.
    *   To preserve the original ideals envisioned by the constitution makers, SC pronounced the doctrine of 'Basic Structure' -- Parliament could not distort,damage or alter the basic features.


*   'Basic Structure' = not mentioned in the constitution.
    *   Basic Structure : First time mentioned in {[[Kesavananda Bharti Case]]} in {1973}
    *   Since then, SC = {interpreter} of the constitution and the {arbiter} of all the amendments made by the parliament.
