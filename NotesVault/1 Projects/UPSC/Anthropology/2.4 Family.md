# Family

## Definition and Universality

### Definitional Dilemma #spaced
-   Research by **Jan Trost (1990)** -> difficulty and diversity with which people identify those who should or shouldn't be labelled as family.
    -   For some in her sample, family consisted if only closest family members (nuclear family)
    -   While for others, it extended to other kins, friends and even pets.
-   Defining the family does not end with the determining of family membership, family definitions are also linked to ideological differences.
    - **Examples of definition of family not being limited to structure but also oriented to both ideology and process. (Researcher?)** #QnA
        -   **Researcher**: John Scanzoni and colleagues, 1980s.
            -   Tried expanding the traditional definition of the family (= two parents + child/children)
                > All other family forms or sequencing tent to be labelled as deviant(as in research on minorities) or as alternatives (when occurring among whites)
            - Shows bias based on one's own conditioning while defining the family.
        -   **Researcher**: Kathleen Gough
            -   Defines the ideology and process
            -   States:
				> Our assumptions, values, feelings and histories shape the scholarship we propose, the findings we generate and the conclusions we draw. Our insights about family processes and structures are affected by our membership in particular families, by the lives of those we study, and by what we care about knowing and explaining.
           	- Basically, the scholars personal bias kicks in while defining or understanding any concept (in this case, the family, it's structure and its definition).

    -   What are the factors on which a definition of family is driven? #QnA
        1.  Theory
        2.  History
        3.  Culture
        4.  Situation

### Definition

-   **What is a universal definition?** (General) #QnA
    Universal definition requires the definition to be viable when applied to all situation and societies â€”historically, developmentally, and cross-culturally.

-   **Is it possible to arrive at a universal definition for family?**
    -   Most of the scholars argue it's either not possible ( Settles 1987 ) or only possible to discuss in relation to categories of definitions (Trost 1990)
    -   Most experts (Fine 1993) in the field have concluded that :

        > There is no single correct definition of what a family is.

-   **What is the importance of variety in family forms?**

    Different family patterns are:

    1.  Interesting products of human inventiveness
    2.  Solutions to different sorts of problems which people must cope with.

-   **What is the definition of Family and by whom?** (which encompasses most of the societies) #spaced
    The family in general is a group based on marriage and marriage contract, including the recognition of rights and duties of parenthood, common residence for husband, wife and children and reciprocal economic obligations between husband and the wife. (William Newton Stephens)

-   On what criteria is the definition by **William Newton Stephens** based on?
    1.  Marriage or marriage contract.
    2.  Reciprocal economic obligation b/w husband and wife.
    3.  Common residence
    4.  Rights and duties of parenthood.

## Basic structure of the Human Family

-   **What is the difference between a mating relationship and conjugal relationship?** #QnA
    -   Mating relationship is just sexual relationship
    -   Conjugal relationship is institutionalized mating relationship established by Family.

> Without ==conjugal== relationship, there cannot be an establishment of a family.

### Nuclear Family

- Symbolic diagram for Nuclear Family #QnA
	![Nuclear family diagram|250](../../../3%20Resources/Markor_2020-12-03T10-15-37.jpg)

-   organised around ==Conjugal== tie between husband and wife.
-   consists of husband, wife and children
-   Murdock 1949 -> nuclear family is ==universal social institution==
    -   **disputed** based on the examples of Nayars and ==Israeli Kibbutz== where one spouse is completely missing.
-   ideal for societies with ==high degree of mobility==
    -   hunter gatherer societies
        -   most adapted for it
        -   more than 3/4 of the HG Societies have nuclear families.
        -   though the nuclear families not really that independent as they camp near the kin.
    -   modern industrial societies
-   ideal in very small percentage of societies (<5%)
-   ideally has its own residence -> away from the parents
-   since separate domestic and economic unit --> marginal interference by kins/relative.
-   some ideals about different roles to be played, exist:
    -   economic support
    -   sexual activity
    -   child care
-   however, the roles aren't rigid

#### Dissolution of nuclear family

-   doesn't affect larger kin, affects only the nuclear unit.
-   Reasons?
    -   Due to divorce - failure to carry out the familial roles
    -   Due to death of a spouse.

#### Various functions in a nuclear family

| Function                  | Nuclear Family (Currently)     | General Families (Past)                |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Economic Activities       | Economic consumption by family | Economic productivity  by Family group |
| Leisure, Recreation       | peers                          | family group                           |
| Care                      | state sponsored schemes        | family / kin                           |
| Socialisation of children | schools and such institutions  | big families or kins                   |

##### Effect of declining functions of the nuclear family

-   increased expectation from family to satisfy the needs of *affection* and *intimacy*
-   personal happiness has become a primary cultural value.
-   nuclear family is not fully capable in satisfying these growing needs

### Sub-Nuclear Family

![Sub-Nuclear Family Diagram|250](../../../3%20Resources/Markor_2020-12-03T10-43-33.jpg)

-   A family characterized by presence of only the spouses with no children.
-   doesn't fulfil the criterion of nuclear family.

### Composite Family

-   aggregates of nuclear family linked by common spouse
-   Two types
    -   polygynous household
        -   one man, multiple wives
        -   each wife separate residence (generally)
            ![Polygynous Composite Family Diagram|250](../../../3%20Resources/Markor_2020-12-03T10-45-36.jpg)
    -   Polyandrous household
        -   one wife, multiple husbands
        -   #insertDiagram
-   the dynamics of compound family is different from a normal nuclear family.
    -   children are particularly very closer to respective mothers --> strong tie
    -   other relationship strength varies
    -   the interaction between the co-woves is important for analysing the dynamics if a compound family.

### Extended Family

-   Extended Family = ==Consanguineal== family (other name)
-   **Definition** : Consists of two or more ==lineally linked== kin of same sex, their spouses and off-springs occupying a single household of a household head.
