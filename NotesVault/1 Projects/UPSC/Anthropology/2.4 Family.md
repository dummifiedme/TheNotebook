### Nuclear Family
![Nuclear family diagram](../../../3%20Resources/Markor_2020-12-03T10-15-37.jpg)
-   organised around ==Conjugal== tie between husband and wife.
-   consists of husband, wife and children
-   Murdock 1949 -> nuclear family is ==universal social institution==
    -   **disputed** based on the examples of Nayars and ==Israeli Kibbutz== where one spouse is completely missing.
-   ideal for societies with ==high degree of mobility==
    -   hunter gatherer societies
        -   most adapted for it
        -   more than 3/4 of the HG Societies have nuclear families.
        -   though the nuclear families not really that independent as they camp near the kin.
    -   modern industrial societies
-   ideal in very small percentage of societies (<5%)
-   ideally has its own residence -> away from the parents
-   since separate domestic and economic unit --> marginal interference by kins/relative.
-   some ideals about different roles to be played, exist:
    -   economic support
    -   sexual activity
    -   child care
-   however, the roles aren't rigid

#### Dissolution of nuclear family

-   doesn't affect larger kin, affects only the nuclear unit.
-   Reasons?
    -   Due to divorce - failure to carry out the familial roles
    -   Due to death of a spouse.

#### Various functions in a nuclear family

| Function                  | Nuclear Family (Currently)     | General Families (Past)                |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Economic Activities       | Economic consumption by family | Economic productivity  by Family group |
| Leisure, Recreation       | peers                          | family group                           |
| Care                      | state sponsored schemes        | family / kin                           |
| Socialisation of children | schools and such institutions  | big families or kins                   |

##### Effect of declining functions of the nuclear family

-   increased expectation from family to satisfy the needs of *affection* and *intimacy*
-   personal happiness has become a primary cultural value.
-   nuclear family is not fully capable in satisfying these growing needs

### Sub-Nuclear Family

![Sub-Nuclear Family Diagram](../../../3%20Resources/Markor_2020-12-03T10-43-33.jpg)

-   A family characterized by presence of only the spouses with no children.
-   doesn't fulfil the criterion of nuclear family.

### Composite Family

-   aggregates of nuclear family linked by common spouse
-   Two types
    -   polygynous household
        -   one man, multiple wives
        -   each wife separate residence (generally)
            ![Polygynous Composite Family Diagram](../../../3%20Resources/Markor_2020-12-03T10-45-36.jpg)
    -   Polyandrous household
        -   one wife, multiple husbands
        -   #insertDiagram
-   the dynamics of compound family is different from a normal nuclear family.
    -   children are particularly very closer to respective mothers --> strong tie
    -   other relationship strength varies
    -   the interaction between the co-woves is important for analysing the dynamics if a compound family.

### Extended Family

-   Extended Family = Consanguineal family
-   **Definition** : Consists of two or more lineally linked kin of same sex,their spouses and off-springs occupying a single household of a household head.
