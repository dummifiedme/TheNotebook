## Transformation of Families 

### Logic behind the theory of transformation of families #spaced
- Extended Families are more adapted for cultivation based societies.
- Nuclear Families are more adapted for industrialised societies 
- Hence, it was predicted that the extended families will be modified into nuclear families as the society moves towards greater industrialisation.

### Criticism of Extended -> Nuclear transformation theory
- ==Milton Singer== 1968
	- Studied families of industrial leaders in the city of ==*Madras*, India==.
	- Disagrees with the Extended to Nuclear transformation theory.
	- Points it out that patrilineal joint family as it exists in India is a ==flexible== institution.
		- joint ownership of property
		- Mutual obligation of extended kin
		- Authority of household head takes responsible for decisions in consultation with juniors. 
		- transfer of management of modern corporations.
