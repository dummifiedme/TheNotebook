### Constitutionalism

> Wherever 'ism' is used, it means Ideology.

-   Ideology of Constitutionalism = Rule of Law
    -   Rule of Law checks the arbitrariness of power.
    -   Rule of law is on part of the government.
    -   Rule of Law = LImited Government.
    -   Example: Fundamental Right is a part of 'Rule of Law' => Limits the government.

-   Constitutionalism is a feature only of Democracy.
    -   WHY? In democratic countries the power lies with the people. (Rights = Power)

#### Components
1. **Rule of Law**- developed by British ruler Dicey
	- all manner of people are equally subjected to the ordinary law of the land as administered through ordinary codes.
	- **Exceptions to the rule of law**
     	1. Existence id quasi judicial bodies outside ethe regular courts.
     	2. The provision of affirmative actions^[ #digDeep ].		
     	3. Article 361 - the immunity from criminal prosecution amounts to blind aping of the west which under British Constitutional philosophy - all institutions are creation of crown, thus creation cannot question the create. 
     	In contrast in India all the institutions are creation of the Constitution. The provision also carries 	potential for abuse as was alleged from the appointment of Sheila Dixit as Governor of Kerala. #digDeep
     	4. Immunity from the section 499 of IPC to the legislators with respect to anything said on the floor of the house. 
			- Article 105 (MP) and Article 194 (MLA) 
		  5. Diplomatic Immunity.

2. **Absence of arbitrary powers**
	- > constitutionalism abhors absolutism
   - Delegation of powers must be complimented with appropriate norms guiding it's use, and safeguard to prevent its abuse.
   - Constitution is a consequence not the source of rights, which implies people can enjoy unenumerated rights as well, but this dictum is not largely followed in Indian Constitutional philosophy. 

3. **Separation of Powers**
	> Functional Separation -> gives rise to trinity of state.
	- Benefits: 
		1. It preserves democracy and civil liberty.
		2. It promotes division of labour specialisation and efficiency.
		3. It institutionalizes the system of checks and balances.
		4.  It promotes the debates and constructive friction between the three organs often leading to better decisions.
	- Exceptions:
		1. Parliamentary form of government, where in the political executive is drawn from parliament.
		2. Executive is often conferred with judicial as well as law making (legislative function)
