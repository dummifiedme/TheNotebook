### Constitutionalism

> Wherever 'ism' is used, it means Ideology.

*   Ideology of Constitutionalism = Rule of Law
    *   Rule of Law checks the arbitrariness of power.
    *   Rule of law is on part of the government.
    *   Rule of Law = LImited Government.
    *   Example: Fundamental Right is a part of 'Rule of Law' => Limits the government.

*   Constitutionalism is a feature only of Democracy.
    *   WHY? In democratic countries the power lies with the people. (Rights = Power)
