# Body of the Constitution
## Part 1
- Only government shall be allowed to introduce a bill - not opposition or private 
	- Conditioned to be introduced with permission of the President

### Article 3
> re-organization of states
- In constituent assembly debates it was held that powers under the article 3 may be abused by centre.
- Views of Ambedkar on Article 3
	- Article 3 cannot be applied arbitrarily as that would amount to reducing the state to the status of glorified municipality. Yet the consent consent of the state government can not be made arbitrary as that would make task of reorganization impossible.
