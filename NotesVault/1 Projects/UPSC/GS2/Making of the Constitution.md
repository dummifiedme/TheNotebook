#### Introduction
There has been debate on the representativeness of the constituent Assembly or whether the present Constitution of India represent the will of the people in real sense. It has been accused that the consistent assembly didn't represent all the sections of the Indian society, Churchill called it assembly of Brahmins
   - it was dominated by Congress, 
   - in terms of profession dominated by lawyers, and 
   - contradictory to the promises by Gandhi and Congress.
   - no direct election of the representation by the people contrary to the romoses of Gandhi and congress 
      - indirectly elected by the members of the Provincial Legislative Assemblies which were not given any such mandate by the electorate to elect the members of the assembly. 
      - The election of the Provincial legislatures were done in accordance to GoI Act 1935, even the size of electorate was very limited. 
- The basic design was not determined by Indians but was based on the British formula given in Cabinet Mission. 
Though all the above arguments are factually correct, still it will not be appropriate to call the assembly as not representative. 

It is to be noted that the situations in which India got independence were not conducive for direct elections. There wa no point in postponing the formation of the assembly. It is true that assembly was dominated by Congress, but it is also true that 'Congress was India and India was Congress'. To ensure that the Constitution remains a consensus document, Congress had coopted the members of the Rebuplican Party , Hindu Mahasabha etc. Every provision was adopted after deliberation and most of the provisions were adopted by consensus. In 1952, when first general election took place, most of the members of the Constituent Assembly got reflected. Supreme acourt in Kesavananda Bharati case has held that there is no relevance of debate on the factual correctness of the term 'We the People of India' mentioned in the Preamble. The matter is already settled that the constituent represented the will of the people. 

The biggest testimony of the representativeness of the Constitution is the survival of India as a nation and Granville Austin rightly calls Indian Constitution as 'the cornerstone of a nation'. According to Pratap Bhanu Mehta, Indian Constitution is not an ordinary Constitution but a revolutionary document through which an attempt has been made to transform a highly traditional society into a modern vibrant nation, the so called silent revolution. 

### Is Indian Constitution a bag of borrowings? 
It is said that Indian Constitution is a bag of borrowing for the reasons that we have taken various provisions from different Constitution of the world. The biggest influence is of the Constitution of Britain, the parliamentary form of government. Some features were taken from the USA - the Republic nature of India, the fundamental rights. The federal nature of Indian Polity is taken from Canada besides the Government of India Act 1935. The concurrent list and finance commission from Australia. Fundamental duties from Russia. 
Though Indian Constitution has borrowed from multiple sources, each provision was adopted after thoughrough discussions and with consensus in most of the situations. 
There is nothing wrong in borrowing wisdom from the others of we think that it will serve the will of the people. Indian culture has always been accommodative, pluralistic and receptive. We can refer to Gandhi who is known as father of nation thag despite rooted in Indian tradition and culture, Gandhi held that one should keep the windows of house open and door closed. Let the winds around the world come to the house but it should not blow off my feet. #digDeep #quote
