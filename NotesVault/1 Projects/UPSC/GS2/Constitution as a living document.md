### Constitution as a living document
Indian constitution is an organic document, which means natural/living => it evolves

1.  By Amendments (formal)
2.  By Judicial Interpretations (informal)
    *   Keeps on changing the interpretations.
    *   Meneka Gandhi Case is a milestone as it made a huge change in the interpretations of the provisions of the constitution.
        *   Biggest change with respect to the interpretations of [[Article 21]].
    *   [[Kesavananda Bharti Case]] is another example.
3. Through Convention
4. Through Statutes


> Constitutional Law is a wider term that includes all the four things.
