*   Natural Selection -  Genetic Drift
    *   Graph plot with variation -- fraction of population of some sorts
    *   0 and 1 are **absorb states** -- no selection state.
        *   0 when there's no one with the trait --  hence no selection
        *   1 when everyone has that trait -- hence no scope for
*   Darwin - Beagle - Origin of Species
    *   22 year old - medicine drop out - interested in beetles.
    *   Went on voyage onboard HMS Beagle with [FitzRoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_FitzRoy).
        *   ![[../../3 Resources/Pasted image 20201123142151.png]]
    *   Tried to notice the differences in same animals/birds across the location
    *   Came back to London with many evidences/collectibles.
    *   Sea-Sickness -- never went again to ships üòù
    *    Inspired by Malthus while forming a theory of selection.
*   [Malthus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Robert_Malthus) [theory of population growth](https://www.economicsdiscussion.net/theory-of-population/top-3-theories-of-population-with-diagram/18461) 
    *   Population grows exponentially
    *   Food production grows linearly
    *   Land is limited.
    *   Hence, sometime soon, effects of population growth will exceed the food production and space available.
*   Examples of Bat-Moth
    *   Bat uses echolocation.
        *   Sends a very loud sound -- because the echo bouncing back from the moths, would be million time less loud.
        *   Moth hears the sound, it tries to save itself -- goes down in a whirling motion - to confuse the bat.
        *   A mite which lives in ears of the Moth - knows that to survive, the moth must survive too
            *   Mites, hence, lives only inside one of the ears, not both -- to enable the moth to listen and do the needful üòõ
    *   Shows how everything is interconnected and works in tandem with every other thing.
        *   Similar example is of Bat species ()
*   Timeline or Tree of lineages
    *   Single-Cellular
    *   Multi-Cellular
    *   Plants
    *   etc
*   The timespan of study under various disciplines
    *   Anthropology : 15Mya to Now.
