The idea of {cloze paragraph style} is to be able to recognise any paragraphs that contain {cloze deletions}.
However, you don't need to have your notes be files of {flashcards} to use this script! You just need to be fine with {visibly embedding} flashcards in your notes, and keeping them there for future reference/editing.

The script will ignore anything it doesn't think is a flashcard, so you're free to add {context/information} not needed for Anki to your notes.
