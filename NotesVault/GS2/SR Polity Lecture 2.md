## Reasons for adopting Parliamentary System
1. Familiarity with the system
2. More Democratic because the power is not concentrated in the hands of one person, there is a cabinet or council of ministers.
3. It is more accountable on day-to-day basis.
4. More representative, thus more suitable for India's diversity.

## Shift to Presidential System
- India had faced an era of coalition politics.
- Coalition politics in the absence of healthy coalition culture
