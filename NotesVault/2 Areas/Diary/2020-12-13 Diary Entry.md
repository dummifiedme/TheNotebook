# Diary Entry
> Date: 13th December 2020

I haven't written a diary for a while now. I am not really having a great time with career and mental peace. I hope to clear my head while writing this entry.

## Problems I am facing
### Studies
1. No proper Plan for UPSC
	1. I don't know how to proceed exactly. 
	2. I don't have a long term plan.
	3. I don't follow my daily plans
	4. No idea how will everything be completed.
	5. How to approach things?

	Solution:
	1. Make an [[Elaborate Relaxed Plan]] #TODO
	3. Complete your optional first.
	4. Keep writing answers.
		1. GS everyday
		2. Optional every week.
		3. Essay every 2/3 weeks.
	5. Revise using ANKI
		1. ALWAYS
		2. Make small notes from the things you are studying. Like the heading points. So that you know what you need to know. Points could be on tips. 
			- For example: 
				- I can write down the points required to be answered when a question about federalism comes up. 
				- I can easily add the points to suggested from the evaluator or the answer keys!
		3. Notes should always be for ANKI, to remember things. 
		4. Also add the sources wherever necessary or point the card to the markdown note and mention the source here.

	5.
