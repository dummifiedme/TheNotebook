### Types of Constitution

1.  Written and Unwritten Constitutions
    1.  Written constitutions are distinguished on the basis of the fact that they are products of the constituent assembly.
    2.  British Constitution = Unwritten --> Has some parts written too.
        *   Unwritten because there was no constituent assembly.
        > *   No constitution is entirely written or unwritten.
        > *   Even Indian constitution has some unwritten parts.
    3.  Indian constitution is written.
2.  Rigid and Flexible Constitutions
    1.  Basis: Amendments.
    2.  British = Flexible --> Amendments with Simple majority. Relatively Easy.
    3.  USA = Rigid --> Amendments with Special Majority. Difficult.
    4.  India = not too rigid, not too flexible. --> Simple majority as well as special majority. Depends on the subject.

### Types of Majority

> Related Terms:
>
> *   Quorum = 1/10th of the strength = 54 Members
>     *   For any official business, quorum is necessary.
>     *   Voting can proceed.

1.  #### Simple Majority
    *   50 percent (+1) of the members present and voting.
2.  #### Special Majority
    *   Best way to describe??: Neither simple, effective and absolute majority.
    *   Various kinds mentioned.
        *   FIRST:  Art 249, 312 (All India Services)
            *   2/3 of Members present and voting
        *   SECOND: Art 368 (Amendment of the Constitution)
            *   Two conditions simultaneously:
                *   2/3 MP&V
                *   50%+1 of total strength of the house.
        *   THIRD: Impeachment of President (Article 61)
            *   Most difficult
            *   Total strength of the house.
3.  #### Effective Majority
    *   50 percent (+1) of effective strength
    *   Effective strength = Total strength - Vacancies
4.  #### Absolute Majority
    *   50 percent (+1) of the total strength of the house.

Q: In Lok Sabha, 280 members are present out of which 212 have voted. What will be the majority required to pass the amendment in above situation? How many members should vote in favour?
A: Condition 1: 50% +1 Total strength => 273 seats (i.e. of 545).
Therefore, it can't be passed at this strength.

## Constitutionalism

> Wherever 'ism' is used, it means Ideology.

*   Ideology of Constitutionalism = Rule of Law
    *   Rule of Law checks the arbitrariness of power.
    *   Rule of law is on part of the government.
    *   Rule of Law = LImited Government.
    *   Example: Fundamental Right is a part of 'Rule of Law' => Limits the government.

*   Constitutionalism is a feature only of Democracy.
    *   WHY? In democratic countries the power lies with the people. (Rights = Power)

> Democracy is a modern concept
> - Earlier, there was a theory of 'Divine Rights of King' -- transformed into --> Natural rights of man.
> - Now, King is public servant and sovereignty lies with the people.

*   Above concepts are based on the liberal idea of democracy
    *   India is a liberal democracy.
        *   Not a socialist, but welfare state.

> India is a socialist country, but in theoretical terms it isn't a socialist per say, rather liberal.

## Right - Left - Center

*   Right, Center and Left originated in French Revolution.
    *   People sitting right, left or center of the king.

| Right        | Center          | Left                |
| ------------ | --------------- | ------------------- |
| Conservative | Liberals        | Socialist/Communist |
| Tilak        | Dadabhai Naroji | Nehru               |
|              | JL Nehru        |                     |
|              | BR Ambedkar     |                     |

*   > Gandhism is an ideology in itself.

### Liberals

*   Derives from 'Liberty' or 'Freedom' of the people.
    *   Rights/Freedom of the people
*   Countries with FR will be liberal.
*   Conflict b/w people and government => Independent Judiciary is required.
*   Power must lie with the people => Democracy is required
*   Freedom of Press => Another pillar.
*   'Free and Fair' Electoral system
*   Competitive Party System
    *   e.g: **China** is not competitive party system, it has hegemonic party system.
*   Decided on the basis of enforceable rights (FR) not on the ornamental rights (Preamble).

Q: Is there any difference between 'Liberty' and 'Freedom'?
A: For General Studies, there is no difference. :p --> Use it interchangeably.

*   For Political Studies --> various scholars gave different explanations.
    *   Still 'Freedom' is widely used (amongst Socialists) =>  since, 'liberty' got associated with  'Liberals' and hence, 'Capitalism'.
