> " A gigantic quilt of jumbled crochet work, a monstrous monument of shame built by pygmies." 

> Lord Linlithgow - 
> "Afterall we are farming the Constitution as we thought as it was the best way to hold India to Empire." 

> Tomilson - 
> "Reforms were dictated by the needs to attract Indians to collaborate with Raj. It was completely imperialist in design."


### Influence of GoI Act 1935 on present consitution

1. Government of India Act 1935 was primarily based on the 'white paper' released by British Government in 1933.
   - White paper was prepared by committee at British Parliament which also had representation of princely state. 
   - it was primarily based on the report of Simon Commission. 
   - it hardly represented the voice of INC, the only mass party in India. 
2. There was a stern opposition to Simon Commision as well as GoI Act 1935
   - The strongest opposition was from Nehru who compared it to a car with no engines but all brakes. 
      - thus, Pandit Nehru questioned the viability of the act. 
   - Rightly considered as imperialist in design and as mentioned by Lord Linlithgow, the aim of the act was to hold India to the Raj. 
    - thus the two parties were having contradictory aims
      - Congress was for swaraj, while British government wanted to hold the Raj by incorporating the loyalists. British always followed the policy of 'carrot and stick' . 
      - Constitutional reforms have been to pacify Indians, they have always been like a half baked cakes. 
      - response of the British has always been too little, too late. 
3. It is true that the act can be treated as a major progress, considering it as the first written Constitution for India, the introduction of collective responsibility and Provincial autonomy. However they continued the balancing act through the discretionary powers of the Governor and ultimate discretionary powers of the Union. Hence, so called responsibility to the legislature was actually responsibility to the Governor. Hence it was rightly called as car without engine. It was hardly suitable for meeting the Indian aspirations. Yet, Congress decided to participate in the elections, Congress was sure that it will be able to form the government in most of the provinces, it will legitimize the Congress as a real representatives of the Indians. 
 
 
 
###  Influence of GoI Act 1935.... 
What type of Constitution of India will be has been subjected to a lot of debates and discussions with multiple formulae and perspectives. Cabinet Mission Plan proposed weak federation. Center to have powers only on three subjects - defence, communications and currency. However, with the partition of India and the breakdown of law and order situation, alom with the secessionist demands from various regions like Nagas and Mizos, war with Pakistan, constituent Assembly ultimately had to go for an extremely centralised federation. The GoI Act 1935, which was the object of nationalist attacks, because the basic reference to determine the future Constitution. 

The present center and state relations, division of powers, emergency provisions, discretionary powers of Governor, special responsibility of Governor wrt tribal areas have been drawn from the Act. Thus the basic design of Indian federation, which is often criticized as quasi federal is hardly Indian in origin. 
Even the directive principles of state policy are drawn from the instrument of instruction in the Act. Hence, it is an irony that the situation compelled us to adopt majority of the provisions of the Act. 

Contrary to the myth that Indian Constitution was framed int he atmosphere of optimism, it was actually framed int eh atmosphere of fear and trepidation.

### What was the method adopted by the Constituent Assembly for acceptance of the provisions of the Constitution? 
1. Majority of the provisions have been adopted by consensus, though for some provisions there has been voting. 
2. Provisions were adopted after exhaustive debates. 

### Examine the representativeness of the Indian Constitution. 
- Constitutional Representation
   - Non Elected members
      - indirectly elected 
      - nominated
      - coopted members --> Ambekar... Lost elections, but kept in the assembly. 
   - Elected members
- Churchill called it an assembly of Brahmins and one party assembly. 

#### Introduction
There has been debate on the representativeness of the constituent Assembly or whether the present Constitution of India represent the will of the people in real sense. It has been accused that the consistent assembly didn't represent all the sections of the Indian society, Churchill called it assembly of Brahmins
   - it was dominated by Congress, 
   - in terms of profession dominated by lawyers, and 
   - contradictory to the promises by Gandhi and Congress.
   - no direct election of the representation by the people contrary to the romoses of Gandhi and congress 
      - indirectly elected by the members of the Provincial Legislative Assemblies which were not given any such mandate by the electorate to elect the members of the assembly. 
      - The election of the Provincial legislatures were done in accordance to GoI Act 1935, even the size of electorate was very limited. 
- The basic design was not determined by Indians but was based on the British formula given in Cabinet Mission. 
Though all the above arguments are factually correct, still it will not be appropriate to call the assembly as not representative. 

It is to be noted that the situations in which India got independence were not conducive for direct elections. There wa no point in postponing the formation of the assembly. It is true that assembly was dominated by Congress, but it is also true that 'Congress was India and India was Congress'. To ensure that the Constitution remains a consensus document, Congress had coopted the members of the Rebuplican Party , Hindu Mahasabha etc. Every provision was adopted after deliberation and most of the provisions were adopted by consensus. In 1952, when first general election took place, most of the members of the Constituent Assembly got reflected. Supreme acourt in Kesavananda Bharati case has held that there is no relevance of debate on the factual correctness of the term 'We the People of India' mentioned in the Preamble. The matter is already settled that the constituent represented the will of the people. 

The biggest testimony of the representativeness of the Constitution is the survival of India as a nation and Granville Austin rightly calls Indian Constitution as 'the cornerstone of a nation'. According to Pratap Bhanu Mehta, Indian Constitution is not an ordinary Constitution but a revolutionary document through which an attempt has been made to transform a highly traditional society into a modern vibrant nation, the so called silent revolution. 

### Is Indian Constitution a bag of borrowings? 
It is said that Indian Constitution is a bag of borrowing for the reasons that we have taken various provisions from different Constitution of the world. The biggest influence is of the Constitution of Britain, the parliamentary form of government. Some features were taken from the USA - the Republic nature of India, the fundamental rights. The federal nature of Indian Polity is taken from Canada besides the Government of India Act 1935. The concurrent list and finance commission from Australia. Fundamental duties from Russia. 
Though Indian Constitution has borrowed from multiple sources, each provision was adopted after thoughrough discussions and with consensus in most of the situations. 
There is nothing wrong in borrowing wisdom from the others of we think that it will serve the will of the people. Indian culture has always been accommodative, pluralistic and receptive. We can refer to Gandhi who is known as father of nation thag despite rooted in Indian tradition and culture, Gandhi held that one should keep the windows of house open and door closed. Let the winds around the world come to the house but it should not blow off my feet. #digDeep #quote
