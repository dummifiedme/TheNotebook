## 'Procedure Established by Law' vs 'Due Process of Law'

(aka British vs American Systems of Law)

*   British
    *   > 'Procedure established by law' : Limitation only on the power of the executive (has to act withing the procedure defined in law aka no arbitrariness.
    > *   Equality before law (even you are the king)
    *   Principle of 'Parliamentary Sovereignty' which means no restriction on the power of the parliament to make law.
    *   However, this did not remained a fact since Britain joined European Union. So, by Brexit they gain parliamentary sovereignty.
    *   Judiciary cannot challenge law.
        *   HENCE, Judicial Reviews over Executive actions.
*   American
    *   > "DUE PROCESS of LAW" = Principle of 'natural justice'.
        >
        > *   'Natural law' is not written, it is understood by reason.
        > *   'Natural law 'leave that decision on the judges.
    *   Constitution is supreme.
