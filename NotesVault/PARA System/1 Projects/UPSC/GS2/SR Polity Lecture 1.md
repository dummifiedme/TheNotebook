    *   International Relations
*   Nature of Polity is very dynamic
*   Very important than other subjects -- score is not more
    *   Since quality is missing

    *   COmmittees report
    *   aka authentic info

1. [[Constitution]]
2. [[Types of Majority]]

***

Q: In Lok Sabha, 280 members are present out of which 212 have voted. What will be the majority required to pass the amendment in above situation? How many members should vote in favour?
A: Condition 1: 50% +1 Total strength => 273 seats (i.e. of 545).
Therefore, it can't be passed at this strength.

## Constitutionalism

> Wherever 'ism' is used, it means Ideology.

*   Ideology of Constitutionalism = Rule of Law
    *   Rule of Law checks the arbitrariness of power.
    *   Rule of law is on part of the government.
    *   Rule of Law = LImited Government.
    *   Example: Fundamental Right is a part of 'Rule of Law' => Limits the government.

*   Constitutionalism is a feature only of Democracy.
    *   WHY? In democratic countries the power lies with the people. (Rights = Power)

> Democracy is a modern concept
>
> *   Earlier, there was a theory of 'Divine Rights of King' -- transformed into --> Natural rights of man.
> *   Now, King is public servant and sovereignty lies with the people.

*   Above concepts are based on the liberal idea of democracy
    *   India is a liberal democracy.
        *   Not a socialist, but welfare state.
	 > FR makes India Liberal, while DPSP makes it Socialist

> India is a socialist country, but in theoretical terms it isn't a socialist per say, rather liberal.

## Right - Left - Center

*   Right, Center and Left originated in French Revolution.
    *   People sitting right, left or center of the king.

| Right        | Center          | Left                |
| ------------ | --------------- | ------------------- |
| Conservative | Liberals        | Socialist/Communist |
| Tilak        | Dadabhai Naroji | Nehru               |
|              | JL Nehru        |                     |
|              | BR Ambedkar     |                     |

*   > Gandhism is an ideology in itself.

### Liberals

*   Derives from 'Liberty' or 'Freedom' of the people.
    *   Rights/Freedom of the people
*   Countries with FR will be liberal.
*   Conflict b/w people and government => Independent Judiciary is required.
*   Power must lie with the people => Democracy is required
*   Freedom of Press => Another pillar.
*   'Free and Fair' Electoral system
*   Competitive Party System
    *   e.g: **China** is not competitive party system, it has hegemonic party system.
*   Decided on the basis of enforceable rights (FR) not on the ornamental rights (Preamble).

Q: Is there any difference between 'Liberty' and 'Freedom'?
A: For General Studies, there is no difference. :p --> Use it interchangeably.
*   For Political Studies --> various scholars gave different explanations.
    *   Still 'Freedom' is widely used (amongst Socialists) =>  since, 'liberty' got associated with  'Liberals' and hence, 'Capitalism'.
    *   > Some Marxist thinkers such as Karl Marx preferred 'freedom', due to association of 'liberal' with 'capitalism'
    		> - Freedom from necessities is requirement.
    *  
    
	    | [[Article 21]]                                   | Article 19                                      |
	    | :------          :                               | :------    :                                    |
	    | Right to  Life and Personal Liberty              | Right to Freedom                                |
	    | Even 'freedom' could be used, its just a choice. | BUT, the 'scope' of the 'freedom' is different. |
	    | After Meneka Gandhi case, 'liberty' and 'freedom' became same.                                                |                              After Meneka Gandhi case, 'liberty' and 'freedom' became same.                    |

  Indian constitution is an organic document, which means natural/living => it evolves 
  - --> By Amendments (formal)
  - --> By Judicial Interpretations (informal)
	  - Keeps on changing the interpretations.
	  - Meneka Gandhi Case is a milestone as it made a huge change in the interpretations of the provisions of the constitution.
		  - Biggest change with respect to the interpretations of [[Article 21]].
	  - [[Kesavananda Bharti Case]] is another example.

> Constitutional Supremacy and Judicial Supremacy is one and same thing.
> - WHY? It is said that, we are under the constitution, but the constitution is what Judges say.

## 'Procedure Established by Law' vs 'Due Process of Law'
(aka British vs American Systems of Law)
- British
	- > 'Procedure established by law' : Limitation only on the power of the executive (has to act withing the procedure defined in law aka no arbitrariness.
	 > - Equality before law (even you are the king)
	- Principle of 'Parliamentary Sovereignty' which means no restriction on the power of the parliament to make law.
	- However, this did not remained a fact since Britain joined European Union. So, by Brexit they gain parliamentary sovereignty.
	- Judiciary cannot challenge law. 
		- HENCE, Judicial Reviews over Executive actions.
- American
	- > "DUE PROCESS of LAW" = Principle of 'natural justice'.
		>  - 'Natural law' is not written, it is understood by reason.
		>  - 'Natural law 'leave that decision on the judges.
	- Constitution is supreme.
	- It means limitations on the power of both, executive as well as legislature.
	- Judiciary can challenge even the **wisdom of law(legislation)**. 
	- Creates UNCERTAINITY.
		- Hence, not included in original constitution. Later interpreted to be present.
