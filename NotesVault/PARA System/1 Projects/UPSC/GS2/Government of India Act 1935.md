> "Reforms were dictated by the needs to attract Indians to collaborate with Raj. It was completely imperialist in design."


### Influence of GoI Act 1935 on present consitution

1. Government of India Act 1935 was primarily based on the 'white paper' released by British Government in 1933.
   - White paper was prepared by committee at British Parliament which also had representation of princely state. 
   - it was primarily based on the report of Simon Commission. 
   - it hardly represented the voice of INC, the only mass party in India. 
2. There was a stern opposition to Simon Commision as well as GoI Act 1935
   - The strongest opposition was from Nehru who compared it to a car with no engines but all brakes. 
      - thus, Pandit Nehru questioned the viability of the act. 
   - Rightly considered as imperialist in design and as mentioned by Lord Linlithgow, the aim of the act was to hold India to the Raj. 
    - thus the two parties were having contradictory aims
      - Congress was for swaraj, while British government wanted to hold the Raj by incorporating the loyalists. British always followed the policy of 'carrot and stick' . 
      - Constitutional reforms have been to pacify Indians, they have always been like a half baked cakes. 
      - response of the British has always been too little, too late. 
3. It is true that the act can be treated as a major progress, considering it as the first written Constitution for India, the introduction of collective responsibility and Provincial autonomy. However they continued the balancing act through the discretionary powers of the Governor and ultimate discretionary powers of the Union. Hence, so called responsibility to the legislature was actually responsibility to the Governor. Hence it was rightly called as car without engine. It was hardly suitable for meeting the Indian aspirations. Yet, Congress decided to participate in the elections, Congress was sure that it will be able to form the government in most of the provinces, it will legitimize the Congress as a real representatives of the Indians. 
 
 
 
###  Influence of GoI Act 1935.... 
What type of Constitution of India will be has been subjected to a lot of debates and discussions with multiple formulae and perspectives. Cabinet Mission Plan proposed weak federation. Center to have powers only on three subjects - defence, communications and currency. However, with the partition of India and the breakdown of law and order situation, alom with the secessionist demands from various regions like Nagas and Mizos, war with Pakistan, constituent Assembly ultimately had to go for an extremely centralised federation. The GoI Act 1935, which was the object of nationalist attacks, because the basic reference to determine the future Constitution. 

The present center and state relations, division of powers, emergency provisions, discretionary powers of Governor, special responsibility of Governor wrt tribal areas have been drawn from the Act. Thus the basic design of Indian federation, which is often criticized as quasi federal is hardly Indian in origin. 
Even the directive principles of state policy are drawn from the instrument of instruction in the Act. Hence, it is an irony that the situation compelled us to adopt majority of the provisions of the Act. 

Contrary to the myth that Indian Constitution was framed int he atmosphere of optimism, it was actually framed int eh atmosphere of fear and trepidation.
