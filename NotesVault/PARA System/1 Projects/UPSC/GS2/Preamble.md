### Debates or Issues related to Preamble in Indian context
There have been different debates #prelims

1. Whether preamble is a part of the constitution. ✅
	- Berubari Union Case 1960
		- Supreme Court said --> Preamble is ==not== a part of the constitution.
		- In Berubari Union case SC took the precedent of USA.
			- USA is the first written constitution
			- USA has Preamble
			- However, according to SC of USA, the Preamble is not a part of Constitution.


2. Whether preamble is a integral part of the constitution. ✅

	- [[Kesavananda Bharti Case]] 1973
		- Supreme Court overruled its previous view and held that preamble isnot just a part of the consitution, it is an integral part of the constitution.
		- INTEGRAL part means -> it contains the basic structure of the constitution.

	> They admitted the mistake that in Berubari Union Case, they ignored a very important historical fact related to Preamble i.e. ==preamble was adopted by the Constituent Assembly by a motion that it is a part of the constitution==, it means the principles of USA will not be applied in Indian case.

3. Whether Preamble can be amended or not
	- Supreme court in [[Kesavananda Bharti Case]] held that preamble can be amended.
	- Why did this question arise?
		- Once SC accepted preamble as a part of constitution, there was lack of clarity wheter it can be amended because Article 368 deals with amendment of the "PROVISIONS"


> Article 368 mentions "Provisions" can be amended.
