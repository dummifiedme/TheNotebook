	- It is not necessary to attach preambles
	- It is not necessary that only constitutions will have preambles.

### Debates or Issues related to Preamble in Indian context
There have been different debates #prelims

1. Whether preamble is a part of the constitution. ✅
	- Berubari Union Case 1960
		- Supreme Court said --> Preamble is ==not== a part of the constitution.
		- In Berubari Union case SC took the precedent of USA.
			- USA is the first written constitution
			- USA has Preamble
			- However, according to SC of USA, the Preamble is not a part of Constitution.


2. Whether preamble is a integral part of the constitution. ✅

	- [[Kesavananda Bharti Case]] 1973
		- Supreme Court overruled its previous view and held that preamble isnot just a part of the consitution, it is an integral part of the constitution.
		- INTEGRAL part means -> it contains the basic structure of the constitution.

	> They admitted the mistake that in Berubari Union Case, they ignored a very important historical fact related to Preamble i.e. ==preamble was adopted by the Constituent Assembly by a motion that it is a part of the constitution==, it means the principles of USA will not be applied in Indian case.

3. Whether Preamble can be amended or not
	- Supreme court in [[Kesavananda Bharti Case]] held that preamble can be amended.
	- Why did this question arise?
		- Once SC accepted preamble as a part of constitution, there was lack of clarity wheter it can be amended because Article 368 deals with amendment of the "PROVISIONS" of the constitution.
		- > Article 368 mentions "Provisions" can be amended.
		- SC clarified that even when it is not a provision, yet it can be amended. 
- Judiciary applied the creative interpretation and held that unlike USA, preamble in India *walk with the constitution.* 
- 
| India                                         | USA                                    |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Walks with the constitution -> Hand in Hand | Preamble walks before the constitution |
| No contradiction b/w Preamble and main body.                                           |                                        |


- There was a reason to pass the preamble at the last so that harmony is maintained between the preamble and the main body. 
- It may happen that the Preamble starts looking inconsistent in light of the amendments in the main body.

### How important Preamble is in the interpretation of the Constitution
> ***OR***
	> 1. Whether Constitution should be interpreted in the light of the Preamble.
	> 2. Is preamble source of power to any institution where it is not given explicitly.
	> 3. Is preamble a source to take the power of any body which is explicitly given.
