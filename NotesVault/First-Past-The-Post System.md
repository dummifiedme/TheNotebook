# First-Past-The-Post System
- Same as Territorial Representation
- Every member represents a Geographical area aka Constituency
	- One member elected from one constituency.
	- One who secures a majority of votes = elected
	- Simple majority electorate deoesn't represent whole electorate 
		- aka doesn't secure due representation to minorities 
		- > [[System of Proportional Representation]] aims to remove the (these) defects in territorial representation.
