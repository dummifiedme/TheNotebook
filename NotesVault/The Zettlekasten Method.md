## Zettlekasten, Part 1: The Basics
- Zettlekasten = 'Slip Box' -- German
	- a box with slips of paper in it.
	- Niklas Luhmann developed the system
- Small cards --> physical cards are preferable.

### Paper Hypertext (Linking)
- In paper notes, we need a linking hierarchy.
- Better way than numeric numbering is to use Alpha-Numeric.
	- Numeric -> 1, 1.1, 1.1.1  ........ 13, 13.1, 13.1.14
	- Alpha-Numeric -> 1, 1a, 1a1 ....... 13, 13a, 13a15

###  Physical Issues : Card Storage
- Bulky as collection grows

#### Deck Architecture
- No need for sorting it all the time.
- Divide sorting and not-yet-sorted.
	- ![[_Resources/Pasted image 20201121031328.png]]
- Don't sort too often.
	- Keep them unsorted, sort on one day.

## Getting Started: First Card
- Can be messy
- But, start.
