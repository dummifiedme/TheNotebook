## Impact of Urbanisation on Family 

- Family as an institution is changing, just like the other institutions
> Ogburn suggests that the change depends on the degree of industrialisation, of urbanisation and the isolation of countries.

### The Changes in the family
- In **ancient times**, the power and control of the family was in the hands of male members
	- > the power of males was above all in the family — ==Balvenk and Teller==
	- joint family system
- In **modern times** with urbanisation, *three* facets of families emerged
	- Patriarchal  
	- Partial Patriarchal
	- Egalitarian

### Reasons for the changes in the family
- Changing economic and ideological  domains
	- Capitalism
	- Liberalism
		- attacked all the privileges and disabilities based on birth
		- seeped in to the individual -> foundation of new society
		- Rationalism 
- Changing social and political systems
	- Principle of Equality
