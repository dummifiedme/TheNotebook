Essence of ethics -Core qualities, attribute, characteristics, properties of ethics
	Nature and nurture
		Ethics cannot be shaped and sustained in isolation. A person's environment interact with his or her genotype to influence the behavioural outcomes

	A man is not only a product but also a producer of his culture
		A person not only learns from the culture but may also lead to a change in ethical system of the society

		Ethics at each level effect each other
	Ethics are abstract and subjective in nature ie they are affected by individual emotions and perception
		Eg - use of sbad language while anger
	Ethicw are interrelated to each other
		You can't be honest if you are not truthful
		You cannot be objective if you are not tolerant
		Eg - economic depression affectimg climate change negotiations
	Ethical behaviour also comes into play when human interacts with other things also like machines, animals, environment etc
	Ethics originate from a sense of justice previaling in a particular society
		Just and unjust instead of right and wrong
	Ethics are maintained and sustained by a sense of responsibility and not mere accountability to some external agency but also to something within
	Ethical standards at many times transcend the narrow stipulation of law and conduct rules
