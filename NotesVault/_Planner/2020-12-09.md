# Daily Diary
### Regarding M Puri Notes
- For GS 2 -> If I read MPuri 15pgs an hour --- total pages is around 540 pages + 200 pages of IR -> 740 pages @ 15 pages an hour =  50 hours.
- At 3 hours a day to GS 2 -> 17 days.
	- Only polity is 12 days.

### Regarding Study

- Would keep writing answers daily
