### Interpretations before Meneka Gandhi Case
- 'State' means => Executive
	- Therefore: 
	- > State (**POLICE**) shall not deprive a person from his life and liberty, except according to the "procedure established by law (**LEGISLATURE made LAWs**)".
- Liberty term = Absence of Confinement.
 
- **Till Meneka Gandhi Case:** 
	- Article 19 denoted right of a free person. It included many rights, some written in explicit sense and some implicitly (freedom of press). 
	- Article 21 dealt with the rights of a person detained by the police, here' personal liberty' was used in a 'limited' sense i.e. 'absence of confinement'. Even right to life was used in a 'limited' sense i.e. 'absence of death'.
