### Caveats of Ambedkar #flashcard
1. Shuns non-constitutional means of grievance redressal.
2. Avoid hero worship in politics. Bhakti in religion leads to salvation but in politics it would lead to certain disaster and dictatorship. No man should be grateful at cost of his honour no women at the cot of her chastity and no nation at cost its liberty.
3. Political democracy would remain hollow if efforts are not made to address extreme social and economic inequality.
4. The spirit of the constitution can be easily violated without violating its letter thus emphasize/focus on constitutional morality which is not a natural sentiment & has to be systematically nurtured.
5. Constitution is document made by gentlemen for the gentlemen.
