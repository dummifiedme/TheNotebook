### Constitution as a living document
Indian constitution is an organic document, which means natural/living => it evolves

1.  By Amendments (formal)
2.  By Judicial Interpretations (informal)
    *   Keeps on changing the interpretations.
    *   Meneka Gandhi Case is a milestone as it made a huge change in the interpretations of the provisions of the constitution.
        *   Biggest change with respect to the interpretations of [[Article 21]].
    *   [[Kesavananda Bharti Case]] is another example.
3. Through Convention
4. Through Statutes

> Constitutional Law is a wider term that includes all the four things. 

#### More flexible, less rigid
- Certain parts can be altered by simple majority
	- e.g The first, second, fifth, sixth schedule can be altered by simple majority -> Article 168.
- Scope of supplementary legislature
	- e.g Article 70
- Certain provision shall remain operative till such time parliament provides otherwise by law. e.g Article 287.
