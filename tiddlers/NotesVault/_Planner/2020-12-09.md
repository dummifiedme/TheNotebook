# Daily Diary
### Regarding M Puri Notes
- For GS 2 -> If I read MPuri 15pgs an hour --- total pages is around 540 pages + 200 pages of IR -> 740 pages @ 15 pages an hour =  50 hours.
- At 3 hours a day to GS 2 -> 17 days.
	- Only polity is 12 days.

### Regarding Study
- Cannot read MPuri notes for 2 days.
- Would keep writing answers daily
- Ethics? or History? can be started.
	- History is in Prelims too, so can be covered later too. 
	- Ethics will be ignored! -> Cover ethics once now.
		- 3 days a week? -> Atul Garg.
